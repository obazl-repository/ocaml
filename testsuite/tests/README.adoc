= Bazel tests


== overview

Bazel rules:

* `ocaml_test` - for tests that run tests internally and report pass/fail and may write diagnostic messages to stdout/stderr

* `expect_test` - for tests that compile and run code that writes
  something to stdout, which is then compared to a "reference" file.

* `lambda_expect_test` - for test that compile code with `-dlambda` and compare the output to a reference file

* `inline_expect_test` - for tests that run
  `testsuite/tools/expect_test` (Bazel build target:
  `//testsuite/tools:inline_expect`)

=== meta-testing

With Bazel a build target can directly depend on submodules in a
namespace ("wrapped" lib). For example,
`testsuite/tests/basic/float.ml` depends only on `Stdlib.Printf`; with
Bazel this can be expressed explicitly:

   deps = ["//stdlib:Stdlib.Printf"]

Depending on the `stdlib` archive file will also work but is not necessary:

   deps = ["//stdlib"]

Each target depending on the archive file will be rebuilt whenever any
submodule changes, whether or not the target actually depends on it,
since the archive will be rebuilt. Depending directly on submodules
avoids this.

This requires a form of meta-testing, to make sure that Bazel is
handling both dependency strategies correctly. We list both the
archive dependency and the direct submodule dependencies on each
target and use `select` to choose between them.

Flag:

* `--//testsuite/tests:with-stdlib` - controls deps of `test_module` targets.

  ** False (default): depend on stdlib submodules but not stdlib.cma/cmxa
  ** True: depend on stdlib.cma/cmxa

This flag controls the `select` function used for `test_module`
targets. For example, here is the code to build `testsuite/tests/basic/equality.ml`:

----
test_module(
    name   = "Equality",
    struct = "equality.ml",
    deps   = select({
        "//testsuite/tests:with-stdlib?":["//stdlib"],
        "//conditions:default": ["//stdlib:Stdlib.Fun"]
    })
)
----

By default, this target will depend only on `Stdlib__Fun.cm[o|x]`.

== conversion

=== rule: expect_test

For tests whose controlling stanza is `(* TEST *)` and have a `.reference` file for expect diffing.

See `testsuite/test/basic/BUILD.bazel` for examples.

Build the `.ml` file using rule `test_module` and add an `expect_test`
target depending on it.

Convention: the name of `test_module` targets should be the normalized
module name, e.g. `Min_int` for `min_int.ml`.


[CAUTION]
====
Be careful about case. In particular when the file name is
segmented like `min_int.ml`, make sure not to inadvertently capitalize
all the segments. If your test_module is `Opt_variants` but you list
`Opt_Variants` as the `main` attribute of `expect_test`, you'll get an
error like:

   Error in fail: Target lacks providers BootInfo, CcInfo: <input file target //testsuite/tests/basic:Opt_Variants>

(At least this happens on a mac; on Linux you'll probably get some variant of "file not found"
====

Convention: use suffix `.stdout` for the stdout attribute.

Dependencies for the test_module should look like this:

----
    deps   = select({
        "//testsuite/tests:with-stdlib?":["//stdlib"],
        "//conditions:default": [
            ## list of deps, using specific stdlib submodules, not //stdlib; e.g.
            "//stdlib:Stdlib.Int"  ## dep on Stdlib__Int.cm[o|x]
         ]
    })
----
