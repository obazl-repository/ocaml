= notes on bootstrapping


coldstart target:

1. build runtime - all c code, -> runtime/ocamlrun

2. build stdlib, with runtime:ocamlrun and BOOT_OCAMLC = boot/ocamlrun and boot/ocamlc

boot/ocamlrun is just runtime/ocamlrun copied to boot dir

'make stdlib all' builds stdlib.cma using $(CAMLC), CAMLC=$(OCAMLRUN) $(COMPILER)

where OCAMLRUN == runtime/ocamlrun and COMPILER = ./ocamlc (?)
