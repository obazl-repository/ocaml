= build verification

Purposes:

* Verify that the actual build matches the designed build
  ** In particular, verify the
     xref:build_protocols.adoc#_boot_build_stacks[build stacks]. For
     example, for `//bin:ocamlc.byte` it should be `boot/ocamlc >
     ocamlc.byte`, but for `//boot/ocamlc.byte` it should be
     `boot/ocamlc > ocamlc.byte > ocamlc.byte`.
* Verify that builds are truly incremental: nothing is built unnecessarily.

== Method 1:  stdout/stderr

The brute-force method is to log the build and inspect the output.
Build actions are tagged with "mnemonics", so you can search for those
(see the rule sources for the mnemonics.)

* Get and save the location of the command log. One simple method:
+
----
    $ alias bzlog="less -R $(bazel info command_log)"
----
+
Note that the `bazel info` command output is logged, which is why we
need to save the location of the log file. Running `$(bazel info
command_log)` again after a build would overwrite the log from the
build.

* Build with `--subcommands=pretty_print` or `--subcommands=True`
+
Building without verbose output may display progress messages but they
may be repeated and it is hard to pick out the specific targets of
interest.

* After building, inspect the command log (`bzlog`).

You can check to see which compiler was used to build any compiler target using `aquery`:

    bazel aquery boot:ocamlopt.byte

This should show that `ocamlopt.byte` was built using something like:

    bazel-out/<confighash seg>/bin/boot/_BS_vv/ocamlc.byte

=== Incremental rebuilds

Using the above method you can verify that test cases are indeed
rebuilt incrementally after source code changes. For example, module
`testsuite/tests/basic/sets.ml` depends directly on `Stdlib.Set` and
`Stdlib.Printf`, both of which depend in turn on other `Stdlib`
submodules. You can use a query to print the complete dependency
graph:

     bazel query 'deps(testsuite/tests/basic/Sets)' --output=graph

Doing the same for `stdlib:Stdlib.Set` shows that it depends on
`stdlib:Stdlib.Seq`, which depends on `stdlib:Stdlib.Atomic`. So if we
make a change to the last, and we rerun the `basic:Sets` test, only
those `Stdlib` submodules should be recompiled (after the compiler
itself is rebuilt).

So make an edit to stdlib/sets.ml and rerun the test:

    bazel test testsuite/tests/basic:Sets_vv_test --config=show

In the build command log after rerunning the test, search for `Link`;
this should match two "mnemonics": `LinkTestCompiler` and
`LinkVvTestExecutable`. The first is attached to the action that links
the `ocamlc.byte` compiler, which is rebuilt because it depends on
`Stdlib`, which changed. You can confirm that it was built using the
baseline compiler. The second is attached to the test case executable
itself; you can verify that it was linked using the just-built
`ocamlc.byte`. Between those two entries, you can verify that only the
modules needed to build Sets are indeed rebuilt. Try changing some
dependency other that `Stdlib.Atomic`, and verify that the rebuild
changes.

WARNING: Currently all deps in `Stdlib` get rebuilt after the compiler
is rebuilt. This makes sense since they all depend on the compiler,
which changes. [An enhancement: do not rebuild the compiler if only the
stdlib changes.]

== Method 2: BEP

BEP:: Build Event Protocol.  "[A] set of protocol buffer messages with
some semantics defined on top of it. It includes information about
build and test results, build progress, the build configuration and
much more. The BEP is intended to be consumed programmatically and
makes parsing Bazelâ€™s command line output a thing of the past."

Not currently supported but very promising.
