= stdlib

The resolver `/stdlib:Stdlib` contains more than just module aliases
for the namespace. It follows that other modules may depend on it for
something other than resolving references to stdib submodules.  In general:

* Stdlib submodules do not depend in the resolver

So targets (including stdlib submodules) may depend on:

  ** stdlib submodules but not the resolver
  ** the stdlib resolver but not submodules
  ** both
