= cross-compilation

WARNING: cross-compilation will only work for C code (runtimes,
ocamlyacc) at the moment.

TIP: Tools that are used in the build, such as `runtime/sak.exe` are
always built with the target set to the local build host, even when
cross-compiling. Bazel automatically transitions the configurations to
ensure this. So when you cross-compile, for example from Mac to Linux,
you will see both the Mac local compiler used to compile such build
tools, and the cross-compiler used to compile output for the foreign
target.
