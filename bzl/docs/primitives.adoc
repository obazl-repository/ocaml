= primitives

The Makefiles always(?) construct a `primitives` file, deriving it
from the C source files (in `//runtime`) that define primitives. It
uses `-use-prims` to pass this file on most build targets.

This is inefficient, since `-use-prims` is only required if the
primitives have changed, and furthermore it is not needed for all build actions.
