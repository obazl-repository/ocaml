IMPORTANT: The config_setting rule has a `constraint_values`
attribute; buried in the doc (literally parenthesized) is this note:
"The execution platform is not considered here." So a `config_setting`
rule can be used to find and make decisions on _target_ platform
constraints but not _build_ (i.e. "exec") platform constraints.
