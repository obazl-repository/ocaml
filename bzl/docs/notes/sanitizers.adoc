= sanitizers

== macos

At least two of the sanitizers are directly supported by the default Bazel cc toolchain on the Mac. All you need to do is pass `--features=<san>` or set the attribute on your target: `features=["<san"]`. Supported sanitizers:  `asan` (address sanitizer); `ubsan` (undefined behavior).

The Zig toolchain on mac does not support these features.

Clang on mac evidently supports thread sanitizer, but `--feature=tsan` does not work.

Unfortunately it looks like memory sanitizer is unsupported (by clang on Mac).
