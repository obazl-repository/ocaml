`runtime/caml/domain_state.tbl``

This is a header file. The protocol for inclusion is:

```
#define DOMAIN_STATE(c_type, name) ...
#include "../runtime/caml/domain_state.tbl"
#undef DOMAIN_STATE
```

Included in:

* `asmcomp/arm64.S` and the other `.S` files in `asmcomp`

* `runtime/caml/domain_state.h`

* `utils/domainstate.ml.c`, `utils/domainstate.mli.c`


Preprocessed using the CPP preprocessor configured by `./configure`:

* `utils/domainstate.ml` produced by preprocessing

  ** `utils/domainstate.ml.c` and `runtime/caml/domain_state.tbl`

* `utils/domainstate.mli` produced by preprocessing

  ** `utils/domainstate.mli.c` and `runtime/caml/domain_state.tbl`

Preprocessed by awk to produce assembler code:

* `runtime/domain_state64.inc` produced by:

  ** `runtime/gen_domain_state64_inc.awk`
  **  `runtime/caml/domain_state.tbl`

Similar for `runtime/domain_state32.inc` and "nt" variants

`domain_state64.inc` is included in `runtime/amd64nt.asm` (windows only?)
