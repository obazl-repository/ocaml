= cmm

Acronym for "c-minus-minus".  See link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C--[C--] (wikipedia) for background.

OCaml uses a custom form of cmm as an intermediate representation.
Developers may configure the compiler with `--enable-cmm-invariants`
to enable "extra sanity checks" on the cmm. This is for native code
only. The checks can also be enabled for a single compiler run by
passing `-dcmm-invariants`.
