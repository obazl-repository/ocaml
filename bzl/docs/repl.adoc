= repl

a/k/a `ocaml`

* `bazel build //toplevel:ocaml.byte` - builds `ocaml` under standard build protocol
* `//toplevel:ocaml` - alias for `//toplevel:ocaml.byte`
* `bazel run //toplevel:repl` - builds and runs `//toplevel:ocaml.byte`
* `bazel run @dev//bin:repl` - runs `@dev//bin:ocaml` directly (no rebuild)
* `//test:repl` - builds and runs `ocaml.byte` under the `test`
  protocol, using `@dev//bin:ocamlc.opt` (not yet implemented)

WARNING: These `bazel run` commands launch the repl from a
Bazel-controlled directory, _not_ from the directory in which `bazel
run` was executed. This means that toplevel commands like `#directory`
and `#use` must use absolute paths. This shortcoming will be addressed
in a future version.  See also xref:tool_runners.adoc[Tool runners].
